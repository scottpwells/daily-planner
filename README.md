Project Name:  daily planner

Summary:

project daily planner tasked me with creating a simple calendar application that allows users to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. So
that the app would run in a browser and feature the momentjs library to dynamically update HTML and CSS powered by JQuery to display the date and hour of the work day
between 9 to 5. Such that when a user inputs there schedule by the hour it one saves the hourly schedule to local storage and presents the present hour time block in red
and the past time blocks in grey and future time blocks in green. Below I included a function link to the web application.

Project Criteria:


## User Story

```
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```


## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```


Project Notes:

This was a challenging project. Particularly consolidating and saving text to local storage, but
in this project I was able to execute and you can see in the working and functioning application
that has the correct color blocks and allows a user to add activity and save there schedule by the hour.
